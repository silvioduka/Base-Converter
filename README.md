In mathematics, a base is the number of different digits or combination of digits and letters that a system of counting uses to represent numbers. 

For example, the most common base used today is the decimal system. Because "dec" means 10, it uses the 10 digits from 0 to 9. 

A decimal number has base 10, a binary has base 2, an octal has base 8, etc. 

Given a non-negative integer & a base as input, create a program to convert the given decimal into the corresponding base. 

Some Examples: 

Input: 25 7 

Output: 34 

Input: 368 4 

Output: 11300 

Input: 78 3 

Output: 2220
